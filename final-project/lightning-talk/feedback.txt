I think what might make most sense in your situation is to try to build a model (most likely a linear regression) to predict what the cost of acquisition would be, given the set of variables you are working with. Plug in the time period, media format, location, etc and try to get a sense for what your COA would be, which, your company can then use to see if a marketing campaign would be worth doing. Rather than finding some ideal and finite marketing spend, this would give you flexibility to evaluate profitibility regardless of what your budget might be.
